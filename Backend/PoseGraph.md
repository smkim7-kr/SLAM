# Detailed Concepts of Pose Graph-Based SLAM

Pose Graph-Based SLAM is an optimization-based approach for mapping and localization in robotics, using a graph structure to represent spatial relationships. It represents the environment through **nodes** (robot poses at different positions) and **edges** (relative transformations between nodes). Each node $N_i$ in the graph represents a robot pose, while each edge $E_{ij}$ corresponds to a relative pose measurement between two connected nodes.

### 1. Pose Graph Structure
- A pose graph is essentially a data structure that models spatial relationships.
- **Nodes** indicate positions or orientations in space, and **edges** represent relative poses, allowing the system to capture and model how the robot moves through an environment.
- The graph supports both **2D** and **3D** representations, which means it is applicable in various robotic scenarios like SLAM, where spatial relationships and mapping are key.

### 2. Pose Graph-Based SLAM Pipeline
Pose Graph SLAM, introduced by Lu and Milios (1997), minimizes mapping errors in large environments by optimizing accumulated error. It consists of a **Front-End** and a **Back-End**.

- **Front-End**: 
  - Generates the pose graph using sensor data (e.g., LiDAR, cameras).
  - The sensor data feeds into algorithms (like Visual SLAM, LiDAR SLAM) to construct the pose graph, where each pose is connected to its previous pose through relative motion.

- **Back-End**:
  - Minimizes accumulated errors using nonlinear optimization techniques.
  - By minimizing these errors, the Back-End aims to adjust each pose to accurately reflect its real-world location.
  - Constructed edges include temporal (sequential) connections and non-temporal (spatially close) connections.
  - Optimizes by applying methods such as **Gauss-Newton** or **Levenberg-Marquardt** for error minimization.

### 3. Least Squares and Error Function Optimization
Pose Graph-Based SLAM relies on least squares optimization to minimize mapping errors.

- **Error Definition**:
  - Errors are defined as differences between predicted and observed measurements.
  - For each edge $E_{ij}$, an error function $e_{ij}$ is calculated as:
    $$
    e_{ij} = z_{ij} - \hat{z}_{ij}
    $$
    where $z_{ij}$ is the observed measurement, and $\hat{z}_{ij}$ is the estimated relative pose.

- **Objective Function**:
  - The goal of the optimization process is to minimize the sum of squared errors for each edge, formulated as:
    $$
    \text{argmin}_x \sum_{(i,j) \in E} \|e_{ij}\|^2
    $$
  - The optimization assumes Gaussian noise, hence fitting a least-squares solution.

### 4. Gauss-Newton Method
To perform error minimization in nonlinear least squares problems, Pose Graph-Based SLAM uses the **Gauss-Newton** method.

- **Optimization Steps**:
  - Define the error function.
  - Linearize using Taylor expansion around the current estimate.
  - Set the derivative to zero and solve iteratively.
- The objective function updates iteratively to minimize:
  $$
  x_{k+1} = x_k - (J^T J)^{-1} J^T e
  $$
  where $J$ is the Jacobian of the error function. This approach minimizes error by iteratively adjusting pose parameters until convergence.

### 5. Bundle Adjustment
Bundle Adjustment (BA) is a refinement step used in visual odometry, which improves both pose and point estimation accuracy by minimizing reprojection error.

- **Projection Model**:
  - Projects 3D points $P$ into a 2D image space, using intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters:
    $$
    p = K \cdot (R \cdot P + t)
    $$
  - $p$ represents the 2D projection, $K$ is the intrinsic matrix, $R$ is rotation, and $t$ is translation.

- **Reprojection Error**:
  - Defined as the difference between observed 2D projections and estimated projections:
    $$
    e_{reproj} = \|p_{measured} - p_{estimated}\|^2
    $$
  - Bundle Adjustment optimizes by minimizing the cumulative reprojection error across all 3D points and poses.

### 6. Schur Complement and Efficient Computation
To reduce computational cost, Pose Graph-Based SLAM utilizes the **Schur Complement**.

- **Marginalization of 3D Points**:
  - Instead of solving for every 3D point and pose, the Schur Complement allows the system to marginalize out 3D points, simplifying the problem.
  - For a reduced system, this approach only requires solving for camera poses by focusing on essential parameters.

- **Efficiency in Large-Scale Systems**:
  - The Schur Complement results in a simplified linear system:
    $$
    S = A - B^T C^{-1} B
    $$
  - This process drastically reduces computational requirements, making large-scale systems more manageable by focusing on pose increments.

In summary, Pose Graph-Based SLAM combines graph-based spatial representations with optimization techniques to minimize error, enhancing the precision and reliability of mapping in robotics. The method uses least squares, Gauss-Newton, and Bundle Adjustment for accurate estimation, while the Schur Complement ensures computational efficiency in large systems.
